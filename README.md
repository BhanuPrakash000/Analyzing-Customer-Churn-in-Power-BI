# Analyzing-Customer-Churn-in-Power-BI
## About the project
  This Power BI case study focuses on customer churn analysis for subscription-based businesses. Using a dataset from a fictional telecom company called Databel, you'll explore churn rates to uncover not only the "what" but also the "why" behind customer attrition. The goal is to identify actionable insights to reduce churn while applying Power BI skills like creating measures, calculated columns, and engaging report pages.
## The problem
Understanding not only the churn rate but also the underlying reasons behind customer attrition is crucial for improving customer retention. This case study tackles this issue using a dataset from a fictional telecom company, Databel. By leveraging Power BI tools to analyze, measure, and visualize churn, the goal is to provide actionable insights to address and reduce churn effectively.
## Results
* Sucessfully provided the highest churn rate state for month to month contract.
* Customers aged 50 and above who are not enrolled in a group plan exhibit a churn rate of 50% . Beyond this age, the churn rate continues to increase. Transitioning customers into group plans from a one-year to a two-year contract could effectively reduce churn rates within this segment.
* California has the highest churn rate among all states. Notably, there were 44 customer service calls recorded in California, yet this state also has the lowest number of customer service calls overall.
